Kia ora I’m Mark, a Channels Manager working at the New Zealand government Digital Public Service, living in Wellington / Te Whanganui-a-Tara. I grew up in a lively university town called [Maynooth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maynooth), just outside Dublin, Ireland, and more recently spent about 12 years in beautiful [Belfast](https://lovebelfast.co.uk/) in Northern Ireland.
## The strategy is delivery

Yes, I am reusing wording from this [pretty awesome book](https://www.amazon.com/Digital-Transformation-Scale-Strategy-Perspectives/dp/1907994785); I *love* digital and through roles in the programme and product space, I advise on how we deliver at pace, better digital services across the public service in Aotearoa/NZ. I also help set the strategic direction for products and channels, getting agreement across teams;  ensuring consistency, conversion, quality in digital service delivery.

It is exciting delving into wider strategic imperatives, organisational values, helping teams break these down into work that ultimately delivers. I have a passion for great digital experience in its various forms, and enjoy putting in in place the conditions where teams can produce best-build, great design in meeting business and user needs.
## How we make better

Other passions include accessibility, inclusive design, brand, and creative communications. My hobbies include running, music, politics, in that I am passionate about contributing to building better, for current and future generations.  I am also currently learning a little more about Te Ao Maori and the richness of the wonderful place where I live through Te Reo, Treaty and Tikanga training. 

You’ll find some older posts here where I talk randomly about strategy, product, communications, agile ways of working etc. - all personal views of course!  I’ll be posting some more recent thoughts on responsiveness in a 'post-COVID' world and work in the innovation space soon too.
