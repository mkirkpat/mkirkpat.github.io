Kia ora I’m Mark, a Channels Manager working at the New Zealand government Digital Public Service, living in Wellington / Te Whanganui-a-Tara. I grew up in a lively university town called [Maynooth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maynooth), just outside Dublin, Ireland, and more recently spent about 12 years in beautiful [Belfast](https://lovebelfast.co.uk/), a few minutes north of Dublin (as an incredibly fast crow flies:)).
## The strategy is delivery

Yes, I am reusing wording from this [pretty awesome book](https://www.amazon.com/Digital-Transformation-Scale-Strategy-Perspectives/dp/1907994785); I *love* digital and through roles in the programme and product space, I advise on how we deliver at pace, better digital services across the public service in Aotearoa/NZ. I have helped set the strategic direction for products and channels, getting agreement across teams;  ensuring consistency, conversion, quality in digital service delivery across the public and private sector.

It is exciting threading things together with teams, delving into wider strategic imperatives, organisational values, helping teams break this down into work that ultimately delivers. I espouse a passion for great digital experience in its various forms, and devise approaches, put in place the conditions where teams can produce best-build, great design in meeting business and user needs.
## How we make better

Other passions include accessibility, inclusive design, brand, and creative communications. My hobbies include running, music, politics, in that I am passionate about contributing to building better, for current and future generations. 

I am currently early on a journey to understand a little more about Te Ao Maori and the richness of the wonderful place where I live. 

You’ll find some older posts here where I’ll be talking randomly about strategy, product, communications, agile ways of working etc. - all personal views of course!  I’ll be posting some more recent thoughts on responsiveness in a 'post-COVID' world and inclusive innovation through July 2021.
