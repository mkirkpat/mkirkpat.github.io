Well. Finally got around to putting this old website together. Neat thing about it - 
powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. 
It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.

This is a test list:
1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three

This is **bold**, and this is *italic*
